Steps taken for implementation

1) Batch generation function was implemented and tested
2) Cross Entropy function was implemented and tested
3) NCE function was implemented and tested
4) Baseline models were built and metrics were noted
5) Various hyper parameters were tried
6) Best model was figured out and the models were saved and their output on the test set was recorded.
